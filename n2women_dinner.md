We are organizing a dinner for all women attending SIGCOMM. Dinner will be held on Thursday 23rd between 7 and 10pm at the beautiful Akadémia Klub (Hungarian Academy of Sciences), Budapest. N2Women dinner aims to foster the minority community within SIGCOMM, and make it easier for the under-represented attendees to fully participate in the conference.


## Venue
Akadémia Klub

1051 Budapest, Széchenyi István tér 9.
