The N2Women dinner will be held on Thursday, August 23, from 7 pm to 10 pm in the beautiful Akadémia Klub (Hungarian Academy of Sciences), Budapest. The dinner is open to everyone who identifies with any minority, not just women. The N2Women dinner aims to foster the minority community within SIGCOMM, and make it easier for the under-represented attendees to fully participate in the conference. If you plan to attend, please submit a short [registration](https://goo.gl/forms/aToMCA8rQw2MJkVg1).
