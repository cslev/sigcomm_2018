# {{ page.title }}

We seek to extend the SIGCOMM experience by tutorials on selected topics given by renowned scientists and	practitioners in their fields. We therefore solicit proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community.

Tutorials must cover advanced topics that fit the scope of SIGCOMM and are of current interest to the SIGCOMM community. Tutorials may be lectures, interactive workshops, hands-on training, or any combination of the above. Exploring diverse ways of interacting with the audience and cross disciplinary topics are welcome.

## Where To Submit

Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, should not exceed three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the Tutorial Chairs.

[Submit a Tutorial Proposal](mailto:smel@arccn.ru,szabolcs.malomsoky@ericsson.com?subject=[SIGCOMM 2018] Tutorial Proposal){: data-role="button" class="button" }

## <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> Important dates

{% include dates.html track = "tutorials" %}

## Proposals must include:

- A **motivation** for the tutorial (why this, why now, why at SIGCOMM?)

- An **outline** of the tutorial content, including its tentative schedule (over a half-day or full-day)

- The **type** of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on)

- **References** to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable) including their date, venue, topics and number of participants and the motivation for the new proposal

- **Venue requirements** for the tutorial room (please note that our capabilities in fulfilling unusual requests are limited)

- **Requirements for the attendees** (e.g., must bring own laptop or other hardware, familiarity with certain technologies or topics, etc.)

- Any **restrictions** (e.g., number of participants)

## Important notes:

- It is *recommended* that there are up to three speakers for a full-day tutorial and up to two speakers for a half-day tutorial.

- Tutorials will likely be held in parallel with the workshops, i.e., Monday and/or Friday of the SIGCOMM week.

- Upon acceptance of a tutorial proposal, either the tutorial co-chair or the tutorial speakers can request a cancellation of the tutorial if there is clear evidence indicating low attendance of the tutorial by the early registration deadline.

- Compensation to tutorial speakers will not be provided.
