The ACM SIGCOMM 2018 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of data communication networks and networked systems. SIGCOMM’18 takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks and networked systems, including packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, sensors, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, internet-of-things, novel applications of machine learning to networking, and usability of underlying networking technologies.

We want SIGCOMM'18 to be daring and emphasize novelty and creativity. The more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all aspects, and the review process will take this into account.  We encourage authors to discuss not only the benefits but also the limitations of their ideas.

Unlike in previous years, SIGCOMM’18 will not have a separate experience track. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel networking technologies and systems. 

In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2018 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, a travel grant program, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.

# Submissions
SIGCOMM is a highly selective conference where papers report novel results typically substantiated by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references. 

Detailed submission instructions can be found [here](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2018/submission.html).

# Ethical Concerns
Authors must as part of the submission process attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one’s institution’s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.
