Registration for the SIGCOMM 2018 main conference (including all its parallel events), workshops, and tutorials is managed via a [RegOnline website](https://regonline.com/acmsigcomm2018). Note that free registration for the
SIGCOMM 2018 [hackathon](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2018/hackathon.html) and [N2Women dinner](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2018/n2women_dinner.html) will be available on the respective pages of the SIGCOMM 2018 website.

To promote participation in the workshops, SIGCOMM 2018 offers discounted
workshop registrations to attendees of the main conference. A
main-conference attendee may register for a workshop at a discounted fee of
$100.


Also, participants who register for a Monday or Friday workshop or tutorial
may freely attend another workshop on the same day. 
However, a tutorial may be attended only by the participants who registered for this
particular tutorial. 
To help with room allocation, the registration must be done for the workshop or tutorial that the registrant will attend the most during the day.


Each accepted paper and poster must be presented by one of its authors at
the SIGCOMM 2018 main conference or workshop. If the presenting author is a
student, the author may register at the student rate, i.e., SIGCOMM 2018
does not require a full-rate registration from student authors.

The Early Registration deadline is on **July 14**.
