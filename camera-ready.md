For each event of SIGCOMM 2018 that publishes proceedings, the proceedings will be produced via the HotCRP site used for the review process. The HotCRP site will collect the final papers and interface with the ACM to manage publication rights for the papers.

The authors must revise the original submission to address the reviewers' concerns and, if the paper is subject to shepherding, obtain an explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd.

For the final paper to be published, it is imperative to prepare the final version using the new ACM template (using `sigconf` document type) from the [2017 ACM consolidated template package](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) ([you can also use this barebone LaTeX template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template)). Different from the old SIGCOMM template, the new template allocates less space for the paper content on the first page, but allows more content overall by using a 9-point font. Do not number pages. Embed all the fonts in the PDF file.

The total length of the final paper with all its content included has an upper limit:

- For the __main conference__, this upper limit is **14 pages**
- For the __workshop papers__,  the upper limit is **6 pages**, unless the chairs of the workshop explicitly reduce the limit.

As described on the above template webpage, the authors should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on [ACM CCS website](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012).

The authors must insert the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip into the final paper. The ACM will use its automated system to email this information to the authors. Please set your email spam settings to allow messages from "rightsreview@acm.org".

If you have any questions about the camera-ready process, feel free to contact SIGCOMM 2018 publication chair [Sergey Gorinsky](mailto:sergey.gorinsky@imdea.org?subject=[SIGCOMM 2017]).
