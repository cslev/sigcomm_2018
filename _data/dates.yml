# Special considerations for the index page:
# - info: Workshop proposals due
# - index page will show date only if important==true

# All listed dates will appear in the specified order, so for chronological order, please place your items in a chronological order :D

# info: general info field included in the corresponding site
# info_main: the same info with additional text appearing in the home page
# i.e., submission deadline for papers, but Main conference submission deadline for the home page to avoid confusing other submission deadlines...entendi?
# HOWEVER, info_main will only appear on the main site if important:true is present!

#set the number of items to show before older dates in the header of js/script.js
