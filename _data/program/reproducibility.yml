#  abstract: The Computer Science (CS) culture is gentle to accepting papers that are
#    non-reproducible as long as they appear plausible. In this paper, we discuss some
#    of the challenges with reproducibility and a set of recommendations that we as
#    a community can undertake to initiate a cultural change.

#  title: Towards an Ecosystem for Reproducible Research in Computer Networking
#  authors: Quirin Scheitle (Technical University of Munich); Matthias Wählisch (Freie
#    Universität Berlin); Oliver Gasser (Technical University of Munich); Thomas C.
#    Schmidt (HAW Hamburg); Georg Carle (Technical University of Munich)
#  abstract: Reproducibility is key to rigorous scientific progress. However, many
#    publications in the computer networks community lack support for reproducibility.
#    In this paper, we argue that the lack is mainly rooted in the additional effort
#    that authors need to spend, without expecting sufficient benefits. Based on our
#    experience in both authoring reproducible research and reproducing publications,
#    we propose an ecosystem that incentivizes authors and reproducers to invest additional
#    effort. This ecosystem consists of various building blocks, which can be combined
#    into venue-specific profiles. A key building block is the Reproducibility Challenge,
#    which we suggest to co-locate with annual SIGCOMM conference to leverage reproducibility
#    research in practice.

#  title: Learning Reproducibility with a Yearly Networking Contest
#  authors: Marco Canini (KAUST); Jon Crowcroft (University of Cambridge)
#  abstract: Better reproducibility of networking research results is currently a major
#    goal that the academic community is striving towards. This position paper makes
#    the case that improving the extent and pervasiveness of reproducible research
#    can be greatly fostered by organizing a yearly international contest. We argue
#    that holding a contest undertaken by a plurality of students will have benefits
#    that are two-fold. First, it will promote hands-on learning of skills that are
#    helpful in producing artifacts at the replicable-research level. Second, it will
#    advance the best practices regarding environments, testbeds, and tools that will
#    aid the tasks of reproducibility evaluation committees by and large.

#    Rizk (Technische Universität Darmstadt); Stefan Geißler, Thomas Zinner (University
#    of Würzburg); Martina Zitterbart (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)
#  abstract: Reproducing research results, as it is required for peer review, can be
#    a time-consuming and difficult task. In this work, we propose three approaches
#    to improve the way of how research results can be substantiated and discuss their
#    applicability. Our proposals are based on a brief study on evaluation methods
#    (for SDN research) and insights from a comprehensive discussion on reproducibility.

#  title: 'Best of CCR: Learning Networking by Reproducing Research Results'
#  authors: Lisa Yan (Stanford University)
#  abstract: In the past five years, the graduate networking course at Stanford has
#    assigned over 200 students the task of repro- ducing results from over 40 networking
#    papers. We began the project as a means of teaching both engineering rigor and
#    critical thinking, qualities that are necessary for careers in networking research
#    and industry. We have observed that reproducing research can simultaneously be
#    a tool for edu- cation and a means for students to contribute to the net- working
#    community. Through this editorial we describe our project in reproducing network
#    research and show through anecdotal evidence that this project is important for
#    both the classroom and the networking community at large, and we hope to encourage
#    other institutions to host similar class pro jects.

#  title: A Meta-Analysis Approach for Feature Selection in Network Traffic Research
#  authors: Daniel C. Ferreira, Félix Iglesias, Gernot Vormayr, Maximilian Bachl, Tanja
#    Zseby (TU Wien)
#  abstract: The selection of features for network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection
#    is a challenge for experts who aim to build systems that discover traffic patterns,
#    characterize networks, and improve security. There are no major guidelines or
#    best practices for feature selection in the field. The literature is full of different
#    proposals that ultimately depend on feature availability, types of known traffic,
#    tool limitations, specific goals, and, fundamentally, the experts’ knowledge and
#    intuition. In this work we have revisited 71 principal publications from 2005
#    to 2017. Relevant information has been curated according to formalized data structures
#    and stored in JSON format, creating a database for the smart retrieval of network
#    traffic analysis researches. Meta-analysis performed upon the explored publications
#    disclosed a set of main features that are common in a considerable volume of works
#    and could be used as a baseline for future research. Additionally, aiming for
#    validation and generalization in network traffic research, the creation of such
#    meta-analysis environments is highly required. It allows homogenizing and joining
#    criteria for the design of experiments and tools, thus avoiding getting lost or
#    becoming irrelevant due to the high complexity and variability that network traffic
#    analysis involves.

#  title: Lessons Learned while Trying to Reproduce the OpenRF Experiment
#  authors: Mohamed Naoufal Mahfoudi, Thierry Turletti, Thierry Parmentelat, Walid
#    Dabbous (Université Côte d’Azur, Inria, France)
#  abstract: Evaluating and comparing performance of wireless systems, like for any
#    other scientific area, requires the ability to reproduce experimental results.
#    In this paper, we describe the specific issues that we encountered when focusing
#    on reproducing the experiments described in a paper related to wireless systems.
#    We selected the OpenRF paper published in SIGCOMM 2013, a very interesting research
#    work allowing to perform beamforming on commodity WiFi devices. We illustrate
#    how reproducibility is strongly dependent on the used hardware, and why an extensive
#    knowledge of the used hardware and its design is necessary. On the basis of this
#    experience, we propose some recommendations and lessons for the design of reproducible
#    wireless experiments.

#  title: Testbeds Support for Reproducible Research
#  authors: Lucas Nussbaum (LORIA - INRIA - Université de Lorraine)
#  abstract: In the context of experimental research, testbeds play an important role
#    in enabling reproducibility of experiments, by providing a set of services that
#    help experiments with setting up the experimental environment, and collecting
#    data about it. This paper explores the status of three different testbeds (Chameleon,
#    CloudLab and Grid'5000) regarding features required for, or related to reproducible
#    research, and discusses some open questions on that topic.
