#  title: What I Learned about Big Data Working with Biologists, Neuroscientists and
#    Climate Scientists
#  authors: Constantine Dovrolis (Georgia Institute of Technology)
#  abstract: |-
#    <p>"Big data" means different things to different people. My interests in this subject focus on the scientific discoveries that big data enable.<br>
#
#    Complex systems, such as the Internet, produce emergent phenomena and unexpected behaviors that cannot be studied through the classical, reductionist and hypothesis-driven research methodology. Instead, the researcher faces the challenge of first discovering those unknown and interesting patterns by mining huge volumes of multidimensional data, before trying to explain, model or predict them.<br>
#
#    During the last five years or so I have worked with scientists from other data-heavy disciplines (biology, neuroscience, climate science), applying network analysis methods in various data mining problems. In this talk, I will attempt to summarize my experiences and "lessons learned" from these collaborations, and contrast data mining research in computer networking with similar research in other disciplines. I will close with what I view as interesting opportunities for big data research in the field of computer networking.</p>
#  bio: Dr. Constantine Dovrolis is a Professor at the School of Computer Science of
#    the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received the Computer Engineering degree
#    from the Technical University of Crete in 1995, the M.S. degree from the University
#    of Rochester in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison
#    in 2001. His current research focuses on cross-disciplinary applications of network
#    analysis and data mining in neuroscience and biology. He has also worked on the
#    evolution of the Internet, Internet economics, and on applications of network
#    measurement.

#  title: Ensemble-learning Approaches for Network Security and Anomaly Detection
#  authors: Juan Vanerio (Universidad de la República/AIT Austrian Institute of Technology)
#    and Pedro Casas (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology)
#  abstract: "<p>The application of machine learning models to network security and
#    anomaly detection problems has largely increased in the last decade; however,
#    there is still no clear best-practice or silver bullet approach to address these
#    problems in a general context. While deep-learning is today a major breakthrough
#    in other domains, it is difficult to say which is the best model or category of
#    models to address the detection of anomalous events in operational networks. We
#    present a potential solution to fill this gap, exploring the application of ensemble
#    learning models to network security and anomaly detection. We investigate different
#    ensemble-learning approaches to enhance the detection of attacks and anomalies
#    in network measurements, following a particularly promising model known as the
#    Super Learner. The Super Learner performs asymptotically as well as the best possible
#    weighted combination of the base learners, providing a very powerful approach
#    to tackle multiple problems with the same technique. We test the proposed solution
#    for two different problems, using the well-known MAWILab dataset for detection
#    of network attacks, and a semi-synthetic dataset for detection of traffic anomalies
#    in operational cellular networks. Results confirm that the Super Learner provides
#    better results than any of the single models, opening the door for a generalization
#    of a best-practice technique for these specific domains.</p>\n"

#  title: Cluster-Based Load Balancing for Better Network Security
#  authors: Gal Frishman (IDC) and Yaniv Ben-Itzhak and Oded Margalit (IBM Research)
#  abstract: |
#    <p>In the big-data era, the amount of traffic is rapidly increasing. Therefore, scaling methods are commonly used. For instance, an appliance composed of several instances (scaled-out method), and a load-balancer that distributes incoming traffic among them. While the most common way of load balancing is based on round robin, some approaches optimize the load across instances according to the appliance-specific functionality. For instance, load-balancing for scaled-out proxy-server that increases the cache hit ratio.</p>
#    <p>In this paper, we present a novel load-balancing approach for machine-learning based security appliances. Our proposed load-balancer uses clustering method while keeping balanced load across all of the network security appliance’s instances. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable and improves the machine-learning performance of the instances, as compared to traditional load-balancers.</p>

#  title: Hierarchical IP flow clustering
#  authors: Kamal Shadi (Georgia Institute of Technology), Preethi Natarajan (Cisco),
#    and Constantine Dovrolis (Georgia Institute of Technology)
#  abstract: "<p>The analysis of flow traces can help to understand a network’s usage
#    patterns. We present a hierarchical clustering algorithm for network flow data
#    that can summarize terabytes of IP traffic into a parsimonious tree model. The
#    method automatically finds an appropriate scale of aggregation so that each cluster
#    represents a local maximum of the traffic density from a block of source addresses
#    to a block of destination addresses. We apply this clustering method on NetFlow
#    data from an enterprise network, find the largest traffic clusters, and analyze
#    their stationarity across time. The existence of heavy-volume clusters that persist
#    over long time scales can help network operators to perform usage-based accounting,
#    capacity provisioning and traffic engineering. Also, changes in the layout of
#    hierarchical clusters can facilitate the detection of anomalies and significant
#    changes in the network workload.</p>\n"

#  title: 'Big Data Begets Big Data: Understanding Modern Datacenter Networks'
#  authors: Alex C. Snoeren (UC San Diego)
#  abstract: "<p> While modern datacenters are typically viewed as the engine that
#    powers big-data computation, they have reached such a scale that their management
#    and operation can itself be considered a big data problem.  In this talk, I will
#    discuss our experiences studying the network traffic in one of Facebook’s datacenters,
#    and show how we have been able to leverage properties of the traffic to design
#    improved network management systems.  In particular, we find that in many cases
#    traffic is sufficiently well load balanced across multiple paths in the datacenter
#    that statistical methods can be used to identify and localize performance-impacting
#    faults within the network fabric.  In contrast to most existing network fault
#    detection systems, which deliberately inject probe traffic, we find the scale
#    of modern datacenters allows signals to be extracted from the existing service
#    traffic.  Best of all, these signals can be monitored entirely at the end hosts
#    and allow faster detection than existing approaches.</p>"

#  authors: Andreas Blenk and Patrick Kalmbach (Technical University of Munich), Stefan
#    Schmid (Aalborg University), and Wolfgang Kellerer (Technical University of Munich)
#  abstract: '<p>At the heart of many computer network planning, deployment, and operational
#    tasks lie hard algorithmic problems. Accordingly, over the last decades, we have
#    witnessed a continuous pursuit for ever more accurate and faster algorithms. We
#    propose an approach to design network algorithms which is radically different
#    from most existing algorithms. Our approach is motivated by the observation that
#    most existing algorithms to solve a given hard computer networking problem overlook
#    a simple yet very powerful optimization opportunity in practice: many network
#    algorithms are executed repeatedly (e.g., for each virtual network request or
#    in reaction to user mobility), and hence with each execution, generate interesting
#    data: (problem,solution)-pairs. We make the case for leveraging the potentially
#    big data of an algorithm’s past executions to improve and speedup future, similar
#    solutions, by reducing the algorithm’s search space. We study the applicability
#    of machine learning to network algorithm design, identify challenges and discuss
#    limitations. We empirically demonstrate the potential of machine learning network
#    algorithms in two case studies, namely the embedding of virtual networks (a packing
#    optimization problem) and <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>-center facility
#    location (a covering optimization problem), using a prototype implementation.</p>

#    Huici, Saverio Niccolini, and Mathias Niepert (NEC Labs. Europe)
#  abstract: |
#    <p>We present Net2Vec, a flexible high-performance platform that allows the execution of deep learning algorithms in the communication network. Net2Vec is able to capture data from the network at more than 60Gbps, transform it into meaningful tuples and apply predictions over the tuples in real time. This platform can be used for different purposes ranging from traffic classification to network performance analysis.</p>
#    <p>Finally, we showcase the use of Net2Vec by implementing and testing a solution able to profile network users at line rate using traces coming from a real network. We show that the use of deep learning for this case outperforms the baseline method both in terms of accuracy and performance.</p>

#  title: Scaling BGP Big Data for Network Operations, SDN and Research
#  authors: Tim Evens (Cisco)
#  abstract: "<p>BGP is commonly analyzed with IP flow data (e.g. IPFIX, NetFlow).
#    Leveraging big data methods used to analyze IP flows also to analyze BGP frequently
#    results in a misunderstanding that BGP data can be stored and scaled in a similar
#    fashion as IP flow data.  BGP big data is both immutable and mutable whereas IP
#    flow data is primarily immutable.  Many of the current data stores and platforms
#    efficiently scale immutable data objects covering only partially what is needed
#    to analyze BGP data.  In this presentation, I will explain in detail how BGP big
#    data requires more than a single method of data storage and handling.  I will
#    provide examples using RouteViews data showing how SNAS effectively scales to
#    monitor current states and historical changes for all RouteView peers.</p>"

#  title: NETPerfTrace–Predicting Internet Path Dynamics and Performance with Machine
#    Learning
#  authors: Sarah Wassermann (Université de Liège), Pedro Casas (AIT Austrian Institute
#    of Technology), and Thibaut Cuvelier and Benoit Donnet (Université de Liège)
#  abstract: "<p>We study the problem of predicting Internet path changes and path
#    performance using traceroute measurements and machine learning models. Path changes
#    are frequently linked to path inflation and performance degradation, therefore
#    the relevance of the problem. We introduce NETPerfTrace, an Internet Path Tracking
#    system to forecast path changes and path latency variations. By relying on decision
#    trees and using empirical distribution-based input features, we show that NETPerfTrace
#    can predict (i) the remaining life time of a path before it actually changes and
#    (ii) the number of path changes in a certain time period with relatively high
#    accuracy. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that NETPerfTrace highly
#    outperforms DTRACK, a previous system with the same prediction targets. NETPerfTrace
#    also offers path performance forecasting capabilities. In particular, our tool
#    can predict path latency metrics, providing a system which can not only predict
#    path changes, but also forecast their impact in terms of performance variations.
#    We release NETPerfTrace as open software to the networking community, as well
#    as all evaluation datasets.</p>\n"

#  title: Neural Network Based Wavelength Assignment in Optical Switching
#  authors: Craig Gutterman (Columbia University), Weiyang Mo, Shengxiang Zhu, Yao
#    Li, and Daniel C. Kilper (University of Arizona), and Gil Zussman (Columbia University)
#  abstract: "<p>Greater network flexibility through software defined networking and
#    the growth of high bandwidth services are motivating faster service provisioning
#    and capacity management in the optical layer. These functionalities require increased
#    capacity along with rapid reconfiguration of network resources. Recent advances
#    in optical hardware can enable a dramatic reduction in wavelength provisioning
#    times in optical circuit switched networks. To support such operations, it is
#    imperative to reconfigure the network without causing a drop in service quality
#    to existing users. Therefore, we present a system that uses neural networks to
#    predict the dynamic response of an optically circuit-switched 90-channel multi-hop
#    Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) network. The neural network
#    is able to recommend wavelength assignments that contain the power excursion to
#    less than 0.5 dB with a precision of over 99</p>\n"

#  authors: Pierdomenico Fiadino and Víctor Ponce-López (EURECAT), Juan Antonio Torrero-Gonzalez
#    (ORANGE SPAIN), Marc Torrent-Moreno (EURECAT), and Alessandro D'Alconzo (AIT)
#  abstract: "<p>The exploitation of cellular network data for studying human mobility
#    has been a popular research topic in the last decade. Indeed, mobile terminals
#    could be considered ubiquitous sensors that allow the observation of human movements
#    on large scale without the need of relying on non-scalable techniques, such as
#    surveys, or dedicated and expensive monitoring infrastructures. In particular,
#    Call Detail Records (CDRs), collected by operators for billing purposes, have
#    been extensively employed due to their rather large availability, compared to
#    other types of cellular data (e.g., signaling). Despite the interest aroused around
#    this topic, the research community has generally agreed about the scarcity of
#    information provided by CDRs: the position of mobile terminals is logged when
#    some kind of activity (calls, SMS, data connections) occurs, which translates
#    in a picture of mobility somehow biased by the activity degree of users. By studying
#    two datasets collected by a Nation-wide operator in 2014 and 2016, we show that
#    the situation has drastically changed in terms of data volume and quality. The
#    increase of flat data plans and the higher penetration of “always connected” terminals
#    have driven up the number of recorded CDRs, providing higher temporal accuracy
#    for users’ locations.</p>\n"

#  title: Users' Fingerprinting Techniques from TCP Traffic
#  authors: Luca Vassio, Danilo Giordano, Martino Trevisan, and Marco Mellia (Politecnico

#  abstract: "<p>Encryption at the application layer is often promoted to protect privacy,
#    i.e., to prevent someone in the network from observing users’ communications.
#    In this work we explore how to build a profile for a target user by observing
#    only the names of the services contacted during browsing, names that are still
#    not encrypted and easily accessible from passive probes. Would it be possible
#    to uniquely identify a target user from a large population that accesses the same
#    network? Aiming at verifying if and how this is possible, we propose and compare
#    three methodologies to compute similarities between users’ profiles. We use real
#    data collected in networks, evaluate and discuss performance and the impact of
#    quality of data being used. To this end, we propose a machine learning methodology
#    to extract the services intentionally requested by users, which turn out to be
#    important for the profiling purpose. Results show that the classification problem
#    can be solved with good accuracy (up to 94%), provided some ingenuity is used
