#  title: Programmable Forwarding Planes are Here to Stay
#  authors: Nick McKeown
#  abstract: Many great research ideas and new languages are emerging for programmable
#    forwarding. In this talk, I'll take a step back and consider how we got here,
#    why programmable forwarding planes are inevitable, why now is the right time,
#    why they are a final frontier for SDN, and why they are here to stay.

#  title: 'For Good Measure: Programmable Measurement Using Emerging Switches'
#  authors: Jennifer Rexford
#  abstract: Large networks rely on timely and accurate measurements to detect unwanted
#    traffic, diagnose performance problems, and optimize the use of resources. Emerging
#    programmable forwarding planes are a "game changer" for answering sophisticated
#    measurement questions directly inside the network, rather than shipping reams
#    of data to a remote collector for subsequent analysis. Capitalizing on these new
#    switch capabilities requires innovation in rich, high-level query abstractions
#    as well as runtime systems that can generate efficient data structures for streaming
#    analytics at line rate.

#  title: 'Programming Network Policies by Examples: Platform, Abstraction, and User
#    Studies'
#  authors: Boon Thau Loo
#  abstract: NetEgg is a scenario-based programming toolkit that allows network operators
#    to program network policies by describing representative example behaviors. Given
#    these scenarios, a synthesis algorithm automatically infers the controller state
#    that needs to be maintained along with the rules to process network events and
#    update state. NetEgg executes the generated policy implementation on top of a
#    centralized controller, and automatically infers flow-table rules that can be
#    pushed to switches to improve throughput. This talk will present the design and
#    implementation of the NetEgg toolkit, empirical results on multiple example policies,
#    and experiences on running controlled user studies. The talk concludes with a
#    discussion on the importance of controlled user studies in evaluating new programming
#    languages in the networking domain and the lessons we learnt in the process.
#  bio: Boon Thau Loo is an Associate Professor in the Computer and Information Science
#    (CIS) department at the University of Pennsylvania. He holds a secondary appointment
#    in the Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE) department. He is also the CIS

#  title: Abstractions for Safety of Stateful Networks
#  authors: Mooly Sagiv
#  abstract: "<p>Modern networks store states at individual nodes. This allows the
#    forwarding behavior to change over time, which is useful to implement many kinds
#    of functionalities for performance and security. However, this makes the task
#    of network programming hard and error-prone. I will describe several abstractions
#    that simplify the task of proving the safety of stateful networks. The abstraction
#    include modelling state changes as a finite-state machine, ignoring the order
#    of packet receival, and assuming that nodes can non-deterministically reset to
#    their initial states. I will show that these abstractions reduce the asymptotic
#    complexity of network verification.</p> \n<p>This is a joint work with Kalev Alpernas

#  title: Verifying networks with symbolic execution and temporal logic
#  authors: Matei Popovici, Radu Stoenescu, Lorina Negreanu, Costin Raiciu (University
#    Politehnica of Bucharest)
#  abstract: We introduce NetCTL, a language designed for expressing and verifying
#    network operator policies. NetCTL can be deployed on arbitrary network infrastructures.
#    It relies on performing symbolic execution on a model of the network at hand in
#    order to prove policy compliance or violation. We have implemented NetCTL verification
#    as an extension to the Symnet symbolic execution engine.

#  title: Towards An Auditing Language for Preventing Cascading Failures
#  authors: Ennan Zhai, Ruzica Piskac (Yale University)
#  abstract: In this paper, we present the basic ideas behind a framework RepAudit
#    for preventing cascading failures. RepAudit helps administrators to identify potential
#    root causes resulting in cascading failures at an early stage, i.e., before service
#    outages occur. To the best of our knowledge, RepAudit is the first effort capable
#    of simultaneously achieving expressive, efficient, and accurate structural reliability
#    auditing to cloud systems.

#  title: Network Protocol Programming in Haskell
#  authors: Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Internet Initiative Japan Inc.)
#  abstract: Over seven years, we have developed several network protocol libraries
#    including anti-spam, DNS, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3 in Haskell. Based on these
#    experiences, we regard Haskell as a safe and highly-concurrent network programming
#    language thanks to its strong type system and lightweight threads (i.e. green
#    threads). This paper describes advantages and disadvantages of Haskell and reports
#    our experiences.

#  title: Dynamic Compilation and Optimization of Packet Processing Programs
#  authors: Gábor Rétvári (Budapest University of Technology and Economics); László
#    Molnár, Gábor Enyedi, Gergely Pongrácz (TrafficLab, Ericsson Research)
#  abstract: Data plane compilation is a transformation from a high-level description
#    of the intended packet processing functionality to the underlying data plane architecture.
#    Compilation in this setting is usually done statically, i.e., the input of the
#    compiler is a fixed description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output
#    is code that can accommodate any packet processing behavior set by the controller
#    at runtime. Below we advocate a dynamic approach to data plane compilation instead,
#    where not just the semantics but the intended behavior is also also input to the
#    compiler. We point out a handful of runtime optimization opportunities that can
#    be leveraged to improve the performance of custom-compiled datapaths beyond what
#    is possible in a static setting.

#  title: Toward building memory-safe network functions with modest performance overhead
#  authors: Keunhong Lee, Shinae Woo (KAIST); Sanghyeon Seo (Hyperconnect, Inc.); Jihyeok
#    Park, Sukyoung Ryu, Sue Moon (KAIST)
#  abstract: For the past few decades network functions have evolved much in variety
#    and complexity. Network functions rely heavily on low-level memory management
#    to deliver high performance but such memory management is error-prone. Rust, a
#    recently developed language for safe system programming, aims to support memory-safety
#    with modest performance overhead. In this work we build network functions in Rust,
#    with type-safe guarantees and modest performance overhead.

#  title: Mapping Programmable Network Packet Pipelines to HMC-Enabled FPGAs
#  authors: Jehandad Khan, Peter Athanas (Virgina Tech)
#  abstract: A higher tier of network packet processing performance can be achieved
#    by augmenting the agility FPGAs offer with the sheer streaming throughput of a
#    Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). The notion of a programmable data plane specified in
#    a domain-specific language enables the creation of custom protocol and packet
#    operations. This paper presents an effort to map one such domain specific language,
#    namely P4 (Protocol Independent Packet Processing) to an HMC-enabled FPGA platform
#    by using HLS as the intermediate representation. The use of HLS affords productivity
#    advantages as well as enabling a close correlation between the P4 code and the
#    corresponding hardware units required to achieve the functionality. The resulting
#    code leverages the parallel nature of the HMC to yield a packet pipeline capable
#    of delivering 30 million packets per second (Mpps) using only a single HMC channel,
#    which translates to 30 Gbps of data throughput for a Layer-3 router with an average
#    of 128-byte long packets. Demonstrated here, by using 10 HMC user channels, the
#    system is capable of achieving 300 Mpps (or 300 Gbps) of throughput. Comparisons
#    with other P4 to FPGA endeavors, as well as with CPUs and GPUs, indicate that
#    the proposed system achieves equal or higher performance and lower power while
#    enabling much higher table scale and overall system simplicity.

#  title: Network Verification in the Real World
#  authors: Wenxuan Zhou (Veriflow / UIUC)
#  abstract: |-
#    <p>Enterprise networks have become complex software artifacts weaving together interdependent devices, protocols, virtualization layers, optimizations, software bugs, and security controls. Yet communication is now critical infrastructure. How can we be sure networks are doing the right thing? The fact is, too often, they aren't. Despite enormous amounts of manual effort, outages and security vulnerabilities are common.</p>
#    <p>Can we prove that a network is correct? This is the goal of the emerging area of network verification, which applies ideas of formal methods to network infrastructure. From its recent genesis in the research community, network verification blossomed into a hot area of research and quickly had impact on industry, with startups and hyperscale cloud providers deploying verification technology today. In this talk, we'll briefly review key research advances that influenced industrial verification software. Then, based on experience with production deployments, we will discuss what principles of verification persevered, what surprises we encountered, and how verification is solving problems in the real world. Finally, we will discuss challenging future research directions.</p>
