#  title: 'The Internet: A complex system at its limits'
#  authors: Anja Feldman
#  abstract: 'While the Internet is a hugely successful, human made artifact that has
#    changed the society fundamentally, it has become a complex system with many challenges.
#    In this talk I will outline some of them and also point out a number of surprises
#    in terms of our mental models of the Internet that we develop over the years.
#    Next, I will focus on the evolution of the Internet and discuss methods for detecting
#    Internet infrastructure outages, how to extend software-defined networking concepts
#    to wireless networking, how to achieve predictable performance in distributed
#    systems. I will end with an outlook on how we may evolve the Internet to tackle
#    the future challenges of ubiquitous data availability from sensors and devices
#    everywhere.

#  title: 'The minority advantages: Benefits of being a female professor in science'
#  authors: Wenjing Lou
#  abstract: "Being female in a male-dominated profession is oftentimes perceived as
#    a disadvantage. Special challenges we face can include work-life balance, relations
#    with other colleagues, perceived discrimination, alienation, and exclusion, etc.
#    At the same time, we know that diversity is critical to ensure a robust community
#    and we have seen continuous effort being made to increase diversity and inclusion
#    at different levels.  \nIn this talk, I will share my 14 years of career experience
#    as a female science professor. I will discuss my views on how being a minority
#    can be an advantage in your career development, and ways to make it happen (i.e.,
#    a recipe of turning the lemons into lemonade). In addition, in my role as a NSF
#    program director, this talk will also offer a broad view of wireless networking
#    and security research and funding opportunities from the perspective of NSF investment
#    in these areas. "
#  bio: Wenjing Lou is a Fellow of the IEEE and a Professor of Computer Science at
#    Virginia Tech. Her research interests include wireless networks and cyber security.
#    Since August 2014, Prof. Lou has been serving as a program director at the US
#    National Science Foundation (NSF). At NSF, her responsibilities include the Networking
#    Technology and Systems (NeTS) program, a core program of the Computer and Network
#    Systems (CNS) division within the Directorate for Computer & Information Science
#    & Engineering (CISE), and the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program,
#    a cross-cutting security program led by CISE/CNS.
