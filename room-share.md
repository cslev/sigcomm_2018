In order to help attendees in arranging for shared lodging and/or transportation with other attendees, we created the [sigcomm-18-room-share mailing list / Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/sigcomm-18-room-share){: target="_blank"}.

Subscription is open to anyone interested.
When posting a message, please include any preferences and schedule restrictions for who you would like to share costs with.
For example:

<div class="ui-corner-all custom-corners roomshare">
  <div class="ui-bar ui-bar-b">
    Subject: [sigcomm-roomshare] Need a ride and room
  </div>
  <div class="ui-body ui-body-b" markdown="1">

I'm a male PhD student at the University of S찾o Paulo (Brazil), looking for a non-smoking male to share a hotel room. I plan to attend the conference from Tuesday (22rd) to Friday (25th).

Also, is there anyone driving from S찾o Paulo to Florian처polis for the conference? I am willing to split costs (and drive, if necessary).

Thanks!
