## Outline
This lecture tutorial will cover the following topics:

- Introduction (30 min) - overview on the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things. Historical perspective and current stage of the development. 

- The Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (35 min) - definition of what is nanomachines, nanonodes, nanolinks and nanocommunication per se. Three different types of information carrier: electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves and molecular waves.

- Redesigning the TCP/IP network architecture (40 min) – discussion and details about the transformation required on the TCP/IP protocol stack by these new communication networking systems. 

- Main nanonetwork simulation tools and examples of use (40 min)

- Research challenges (20 min) - This part provides a description of the current research challenges based on the current efforts by the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things community. 

- Applications (15 min) - This part gives an overview of the current efforts in applying the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things in a diverse set of research areas and society verticals, including: Information Technology, Medicine, Neuroscience, Precision Agriculture, Pollution and Industry.


## Motivation, target audience, and interest for the ACM SIGCOMM community
The motivation to present this tutorial comes from the growing interest in the recent evolution of the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things, Nano-Scale Communications and Molecular Communications, that are areas of interest to the ACM SIGCOMM community, mainly issues related to the development and integration resulted from the early stages of this technology that seeks both research and industry efforts towards its realization. The theme of this tutorial will be covered in an introductory/intermediate level. Thus, there is no need of a previous knowledge to understand the main topics to be discussed. Graduate students and other professionals interested in understanding the evolution of the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things and its impact on the existing Internet can benefit from this tutorial.
