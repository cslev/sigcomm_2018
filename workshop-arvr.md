### Call for Papers
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are expected to be the next generation Killer-Apps in the future Internet. VR/AR is projected to form a $162 billion market by 2020. However, many technical bottlenecks and challenges still need to be overcome to facilitate the wide adoption of VR/AR. In particular, VR/AR applications increasingly require higher bandwidth, shorter delay, lower packet loss rate, and faster computation. Immersive VR/AR videos are the representative applications. High-throughput and low-latency video delivery, realtime video generation, processing and adaption call for significant engineering innovations, which can only happen through interdisciplinary research. 

The ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Network will bring together experts from different fields, including video coding and analytics, wireless communication, computer networking, cloud and edge computing, and mobile systems to exchange ideas on novel system designs, and network architectures and protocols to support VR/AR, as well as innovative video coding, analytics and transmission designs to deliver immersive VR/AR experience in future networks. This workshop will serve as a meeting point for worldwide researchers and developers working on VR/AR and networking to share their experience, exchange views, and explore future research directions.


### Topics of Interest
We solicit stimulating, original, previously unpublished ideas on completed work, position papers, and/or work-in-progress papers in the form of extended abstracts. We further encourage papers that propose new research directions or could generate lively debate at the workshop. We invite submissions on a wide range of VR/AR network research topics, including, but not limited to:
- Networking requirements and challenges of VR/AR
- Ultra-low-latency networking
- High-throughput transport for VR/AR
- Adaptive video streaming for network/user dynamics
- Novel CDN architecture and caching algorithms for VR/AR
- Mobile edge computing for VR/AR
- Named data networking for VR/AR
- Wireless and mobile video systems
- VR/AR in 5G networks
- Joint video coding and transmission design
- Video analytics and smart offloading for VR/AR
- Measurement study of existing VR/AR applications


### Submission Instructions
Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at another conference or journal. Submitted papers must be at most six (6) pages long, including all figures, tables, references, and appendices in two-column 10pt ACM format. Papers must include authorâ€™s names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the PC. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop.
