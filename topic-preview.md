Are you new to SIGCOMM? Are you an expert on data centers but have not yet dabbled in wireless or privacy topics? Do you want to learn how to navigate the alphabet soup of acronyms (CDN, DCN, SDN)? Join us for the SIGCOMM Topic Preview Talks in which experts will give short introductions on a variety of topics to enhance your understanding of this year’s paper presentations.

This year there will be 5 Topic Preview Sessions in the main program, each providing context and background needed by non-experts to understand the papers presented in the subsequent two sessions.

Think of a Topic Preview Talk in the same vein as the short editorial you typically see before technical papers in the Communications of the ACM or the Computer Communication Review.
