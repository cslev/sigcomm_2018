Are you new to SIGCOMM? Are you an expert on data centers but have not yet dabbled in wireless or privacy topics? Do you want to learn how to navigate the alphabet soup of acronyms (CDN, DCN, SDN)? Join us for the SIGCOMM Topic Preview Talks in which experts will give short introductions on a variety of topics to enhance your understanding of this year's paper presentations.


This year, as a prelude to each technical session, there will be a 10-minute Topic Preview Talk. The goal is to provide context and background needed by non-experts to understand the papers in the subsequent session, including the lingo and buzzwords, the state-of-the-art, and the importance of the topic. In addition, potential synergies, complementarities, or tensions between the papers of the session will be discussed to frame how the papers contribute to the topic.


Think of a Topic Preview Talk in the same vein as the short editorial you typically see before technical papers in the Communications of the ACM or the Computer Communication Review.
