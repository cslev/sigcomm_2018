If you have been in many European countries and managed to get by linguistically there, you still might be fully lost in what being said or written around you in Budapest. Hungarian is a wonderfully unique language, which is seemingly impenetrable to foreigners. To make it easier for you, Budapest now has a lot of English-language signage in the public-transportation system and elsewhere. Also, the latest generation of young Hungarians tends to speak English well. You can learn more about the Hungarian language in an [entertaining YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikODMvw76j4).
