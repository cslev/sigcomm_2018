For each event of SIGCOMM 2018 that publishes proceedings, the proceedings will be produced via the HotCRP site used for the review process. The HotCRP site will collect the final papers and interface with the ACM to manage publication rights for the papers.

The authors must revise the original submission to address the reviewers’ concerns and, if the paper is subject to shepherding, obtain an explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd.

For the final paper to be published, it is imperative to prepare the final version using the new ACM template (using `sigconf` document type) from the 2018 ACM consolidated template package (you can also use this barebone LaTeX template). The font size must be 10 points. Do not number pages. Embed all the fonts in the PDF file. The length of the final paper with all its content except references must not exceed 2 pages. There is no limit on the number of references. The deadline for camera-ready submissions is June 30, 2018.
