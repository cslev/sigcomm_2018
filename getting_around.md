All the venues are in the city center, and can be reached by foot. Many of the main attractions of Budapest are also in a 10-15 minutes walking distance. 
If you plan to take longer trips in farther places of the city you have a few options:


**Public transport**: See the official guide for getting around by public transportation here:or you can plan your trip here.

There is also a [web](http://futar.bkk.hu/?map=13/47.501/19.053&layers=GSVB ) and mobile ([Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bkk-futar/id916193835), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.webvalto.bkkfutar), [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/hu-hu/p/bkk-futar/9wzdncrdm4h6?rtc=1)) application for planning a trip.

**Renting a car** (for details see here: [https://www.budapest.com/travel/rent_a_car.en.html](https://www.budapest.com/travel/rent_a_car.en.html)) is possible but not advised for getting around in the city center as it is very hard (and expensive) to park, and there is really no need for that, as the main attractions are really close, and public transportation is very good. 


**Taxi**: See the information in the [Getting here]({{site.baseUrl}}/getting_here.html) page.


**Train**: Outside of Budapest, your best choice (alternatives to renting a car) to take a train. Trains are operated by the single company MAV. 

Here you can buy a ticket: [https://www.mavcsoport.hu/en](https://www.mavcsoport.hu/en). 

There are three main railway stations around the town. The suitable one for you depends on your choice of destination. The information for your trip can be found on the (electronic) ticket.
