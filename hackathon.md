## Introduction
The ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Hackathon is an one-day event that offers a unique opportunity for collaboration on the development of new ideas and software related to research topics presented in the SIGCOMM conference. The event will bring together people with a variety of skills to encourage the combination of different types of expertise and inspire creativity. The Hackathon aims to encourage students, researchers, and engineers to gain experience through collaboration in contributing to open source software, transfer their research experience and expertise in open source development, and foster reproducibility of research results.

## Apply
We are inviting students, researchers, developers, data scientists, designers and anyone who is enthusiastic about cooperation, and can contribute new and creative ideas to join us in hacking new tools, documentation and visualizations. Registration for the Hackathon is separate from the SIGCOMM conference; conference registration is not required, but space is limited.

## Details
During the event, participants form small teams, with each team focusing on a given project. All code developed during the hackathon should be open-source and made publicly licensed and accessible for the entire community. At the end of the day, participating teams are given an  opportunity to briefly present their ideas, and judges award token prizes to the top 3 teams.  We expect to publish an article to summarize the Hackathon experience and achievements of the teams to the ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Food and drinks are provided throughout the event. 

Prior to the event, the participants use the discussion mailing list and slack channel to propose project ideas and form teams. All participants are expected to actively participate in the development of the projects during the event, but teams are free to start working on their ideas before the Hackathon. 

The Hackathon chairs will offer a webinar to the participants prior to the event, where we will give a basic introduction to the team members, the logistics and discuss the proposed projects. 


Event Date: **Saturday 25 August, 2018**

Time: Saturday: **09:00 - 19:00** followed by social event

Location: NOKIA Budapest
