### Call for Papers
Motivated by an increasing number of attacks and information leaks, IoT device manufactures, cloud providers, and researchers are working to design systems to secure to control the flow of information between devices, to detect new vulnerabilities; and to provide security and privacy within the context of user and the devices. While researchers continue to tackle IoT security and privacy, many questions remain open. Further, with the growing adoption of IoT devices, we will see a growth in the number of security and privacy issues. The goal of the Second ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on IoT S&P is to bring together academic and industry researchers from the security and networking communities to design, measure, and analyze secure and privacy enhancing systems for IoT devices.

We encourage the submission of work-in-progress papers in the area of design, implementation, management, and deployment of secure and private IoT frameworks as well as measurement and analysis of the privacy and security of existing IoT devices and packages. 


### List of Topics
We look for submissions of previously unpublished work on topics including, but not limited to, the following: 

- Network architectures and protocols for scalable, robust, secure, and privacy enhancing IoT
- Network services and management for IoT
- Security and privacy issues in IoT
- Measurement of IoT privacy leakage
- Measurement of industrial IoT
- Usable security and privacy frameworks for home networks
- Threat models and attack strategies in IoT
- Intrusion and malware detection
- Security architectures for the IoT stack
- System and data integrity
- Identity and access management in IoT
- Trustworthiness in IoT
- Secure operating systems in IoT
- Automated armoring and patching
- Cross-layer IoT security
- IoT ecosystem-level security analysis
- Clean-slate IoT security design


### Submission Instructions
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Submissions should be at most **6 pages in the 10pt ACM double-column format**, excluding well-marked appendices, and references. Submissions are not required to be anonymized. The template for the ACM double-column format can be found here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at [https://sigcomm18iotsp.hotcrp.com/](https://sigcomm18iotsp.hotcrp.com/). Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
