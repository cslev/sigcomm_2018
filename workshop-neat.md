### Call for Papers
This workshop aims to provide a forum for both industry and academia to exchange  ideas about new network architectures, technologies and protocols specifically in the context of emerging applications such as those promised by 5G, with a particular focus on achieving accurate prescribed latency, high throughput, and meeting service level objectives in complex and large-scale networks. 
The goal is to explore possibilities beyond the traditional statistical multiplexing-based internet architecture, protocols, network resource allocation, control and packet scheduling in favor of new approaches such as deterministic packet delivery techniques, data-driven adaptation, in large scale networks, for emerging applications such as vehicular networks, tactile networks, industrial networks, and AR/VR media delivery. Participants will be able to share their viewpoints, the findings, the latest research, and their project descriptions and goals. 

### Topics of Interest
We solicit original, previously unpublished ideas on research/engineering work, position papers, and/or work-in-progress papers in the form of extended abstracts. We further encourage papers that propose new research directions or that could stimulate lively debate at the workshop. 
We invite submissions on a wide range of topics of interest, including, but not limited to:

- New network architectures, technologies and protocols, evolutionary or disruptive, for future applications
- Convergence and optimizations of protocols for industrial, tactile or vehicular networks
- Techniques and solutions for deterministic services in industrial, tactile or vehicular networks
- Network challenges and requirements for emerging, resource-sensitive applications
- Architecture and protocols for ultra-reliable packet delivery at low latency
- Mechanisms to maximize link utilization for high-throughput applications
- Network security and privacy issues in Industrial and Tactile internet
- Resource allocation mechanisms for deterministic and reliable data transmission
- Architectures to enable edge computing and its seamless integration with remote clouds
- New network resource allocation based on data-driven adaptation and machine learning
- Quality of Services and Experience of Service  guarantees: the key metrics that will allow future networks to meet industry demands


### Submission Instructions
Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at another conference or journal. Submitted papers must be at most six (6) pages long, including all figures, tables, references, and appendices in two-column 10pt ACM format. Papers must include author’s names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the TPC. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop.  Financial assistances will be provided to student authors to cover their travel expenses, with the specific process and policy being coordinated and approved by the organizers. The selected papers will be included in its proceedings and published in the ACM Digital Library. 

Please submit your paper via [https://sigcomm18neat.hotcrp.com/](https://sigcomm18neat.hotcrp.com/).
