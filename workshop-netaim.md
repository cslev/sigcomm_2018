### Overview
Distributed processing systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), such as Hadoop, Spark, Storm, GraphLab, TensorFlow etc., are widely used by industry. On the one hand, networking is a well-known bottleneck for AI & ML systems. For example, traffic patterns experienced by ML applications during training can be optimized using techniques such as parameter servers and vertex-cut for graphs. New technologies are also being embedded in the network; examples include RDMA over converged Ethernet (RoCE) and GPU direct. On the other hand, the ever increasing complexity of networks makes effective monitoring, modeling, auditing, and overall control of network traffic difficult if not impossible. Hence there is a need for more powerful methods to solve the challenges faced in network design, deployment, and management. AI & ML have been successfully applied to various perceptual domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and voice recognition. In addition, ML techniques are showing impressive results in new domains such as medicine, finance and astronomy, to name a few. This success in non-perceptual domains suggests that ML techniques could be successfully applied to problems in the network space. The networking community should look upon all these challenges as their opportunities in the Machine Learning era.


### Call for Papers
NetAI 2018 provides a venue for presenting innovative ideas to discuss future research agendas in computer networking of/by/for AI & ML systems. We look for submissions of previously unpublished work on topics including, but not limited to, the following: 

- telemetry in DC
- network measurement
- closed loop control
- AI &amp; ML algorithm for network scheduling and control
- self learning network architecture and system
- services identify with AI &amp; ML
- traffic engineer with AI &amp; ML
- congestion control based on AI &amp; ML
- network security based on AI &amp; ML
- network verification
- network QoS based on AI &amp; ML
- measurement and analysis of network traffic for AI &amp; ML systems
- optimizing AI &amp; ML systems with new networking options (e.g., RDMA, NVLink)
- AI &amp; ML application-driven networking optimization (e.g., MPI offload)
- networking AI &amp; ML computation with large-scale storage technologies (e.g., NVMe over Fabric, FCoE)
- networking for distributed ML systems
- networking for large-scale distributed graph processing systems
- new network functionality for AI &amp; ML system ( e.g., computation in network )
- application-driven network architecture design

### Submission Instructions
Submission implies the willingness of at least one author to attend the workshop and present the paper. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM SIGCOMM conference proceedings. Workshop organizers reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the workshop if the paper is not presented at the conference. Submitted papers should contain original material that have not be previously published, nor currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. All submissions should be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 6 printed pages, including all the figures, references and appendices. The ACM SIGCOMM LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the [ACM SIG Proceedings website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Specifically, please note the following format requirements:

- All papers submitted will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) and evaluated based on their suitability (i.e., within the workshop scope), novelty, and merit.
- All papers must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically. Whatever text processor or formatter you use to write your paper (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, FrameMaker, etc.), please convert the output to PDF before submission.
- Submissions must be limited to **6 pages**, single-spaced, double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns, use at least a 10pt font, and be correctly formatted to be printed on letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. <span style="color:red">**Submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed**</span>. 
- We must be able to print your paper once it is submitted. Therefore, all fonts used in the paper MUST be embedded in the submitted PDF file.
- The paper must be in a state where it can be printed clearly on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to view your paper in color.

Please submit your paper via [https://sigcomm18netaim.hotcrp.com/](https://sigcomm18netaim.hotcrp.com/)
