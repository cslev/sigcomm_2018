# {{ page.title }}
We are pleased to announce that [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) will sponsor under-represented students, postdocs, and early-career researchers who can attend both the SIGCOMM 2018 Hackathon event and main conference. These awards will cover the cost of conference registration, transportation, and accommodation (up to $1500). Note that the award recipients will need to pay for the expenses ahead of time and get reimbursed after the conference.

The benefit for the awardees, in addition to the travel funds, is to participate in the Hackathon and collaborate with other SIGCOMM community members in developing open-source reproducible research tools, and connect with the organizers and participants of the conference who are, typically, leaders in their research field.

## Eligibility
The travel grants will be available to students, postdocs, and early-career researchers who are part of under-represented groups (e.g., women, LGBTQ) in their country of residence , or people with disabilities. The awardee should not be an author of an accepted paper/poster/demo and should not be a recipient of a SIGCOMM or N2Women travel grant.
