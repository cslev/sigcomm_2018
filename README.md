The 2017 site is based on the [2016 site](https://github.com/apietila/SIGCOMM2016), but changed to use Jekyll framework instead of relying on PHP.  The repository for the 2017 site is at https://github.com/conference-websites/SIGCOMM-2017 and the site itself is online at [http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/).

#### Generating site using jekyll

The website uses jekyll engine to generate the website using the templates.  To get started with jekyll:

    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll build

To generate the website and serve it from a local webserver, e.g., for debugging

    bundle exec jekyll serve

## Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

* `_DOCS/`      are various files used to prepare other files, but not directly published themselves.

* `_config.yml` is a configuration file for the website, defining title, menu, and several basic parameters
* `_data/`      contains datasets in YaML or JSON format defining conference dates, news, and supporters
* `_includes/`  are supplementary scripts to generate website's content, including templates for menu, news, google analytics, and sponsors
* `_layouts/`   are layout files

* `css/`        CSS code. Only edit style.css, the rest is 3rd party.
* `css/images/` jquerymobile CSS images
* `images/`     Our images (logos, etc.)
* `js/`         Javascript. Only edit script.js, the rest is 3rd party libraries.
* `misc/`       Static documents served by the site: the calls for papers, PDF of the conference schedule, etc.
* `*.md`, `*.html` Individual pages in markdown or HTML format.

<!-- * `include/program`  Program listings, auto-generated by `scripts/proggen`. -->
<!-- * All publicly-visible pages are a .php in the top-level directory. Subdirectories contain something included in one way or another. -->

The site uses a bunch of 3rd party javascript libraries. You will want to use their latest versions:

* http://jquery.com/ - the javascript goes into `js`
* http://jquerymobile.com/ - the javascript goes into `js` and the CSS and images go into `css`
* http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css - the CSS for the jquerymobile documentation page, goes into CSS
* http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ - the javascript goes into `js`

## Advice and Future Enhancement Ideas from 2017 Web Chairs

One thing that would really be good to automate is creation of "schedule-at-glance".  Right now, it was generated from a google spreadsheet more or less by hand and close to conference dates there are a number of modifications you may expect there.

Consider adding support for mobile apps.

Some of the styling in the program doesn't look too good on mobiles, especially when links to papers/slides are added.  Consider hacking jquerymobile to make visualization a bit better.
