## Credits

The 2017 site is based on the [2016 site](https://github.com/apietila/SIGCOMM2016), but changed to use Jekyll framework instead of relying on PHP.  The repository for the 2017 site is at https://github.com/conference-websites/SIGCOMM-2017 and the site itself is online at [http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/).

The 2017 web chair was [Alex Afanasyev](http://users.cs.fiu.edu/~afanasyev/)

#### Generating site using jekyll

The website uses jekyll engine to generate the website using the templates.  To get started with jekyll:

    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll build

To generate the website and serve it from a local webserver, e.g., for debugging

    bundle exec jekyll serve

## Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

* `_DOCS/`      are various files used to prepare other files, but not directly published themselves.

* `_config.yml` is a configuration file for the website, defining title, menu, and several basic parameters
* `_data/`      contains datasets in YaML or JSON format defining conference dates, news, and supporters
* `_includes/`  are supplementary scripts to generate website's content, including templates for menu, news, google analytics, and sponsors
* `_layouts/`   are layout files

* `css/`        CSS code. Only edit style.css, the rest is 3rd party.
* `css/images/` jquerymobile CSS images
* `images/`     Our images (logos, etc.)
* `js/`         Javascript. Only edit script.js, the rest is 3rd party libraries.
* `misc/`       Static documents served by the site: the calls for papers, PDF of the conference schedule, etc.
* `*.md`, `*.html` Individual pages in markdown or HTML format.

<!-- * `include/program`  Program listings, auto-generated by `scripts/proggen`. -->
<!-- * All publicly-visible pages are a .php in the top-level directory. Subdirectories contain something included in one way or another. -->

The site uses a bunch of 3rd party javascript libraries. You will want to use their latest versions:

* http://jquery.com/ - the javascript goes into `js`
* http://jquerymobile.com/ - the javascript goes into `js` and the CSS and images go into `css`
* http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css - the CSS for the jquerymobile documentation page, goes into CSS
* http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ - the javascript goes into `js`

## Getting started as SIGCOMM web chair

To get started, first check out:

http://www.sigcomm.org/conference-planning/web-chairs

You'll have to request an account at:

http://campus.acm.org/public/infodir/account_request.cfm

For questions or to check on status of your request, you may try following up with ishelpdesk@hq.acm.org.

You should receive further instructions from ACM on how to upload content to the server when your account is setup.

## Other hints
- Once `_config.yml` is edited in order to add a new menu entry, don't forget that since all pages will be related, not just index.html should be updated (on the server), but all other html files as well.

- The program item styles (talk,paper,demo,session,etc.) are defined in `_sass/customization.scss` (for instance, .prog-social).

- Some basic coloring scheme is defined in `_sass/variables.scss`.

- To change the sources of the picture slideshow on the main site, edit index.md. In particular, add your pictures here:
```
<div id="sliderFrame">
  <div id="slider">
    <img src="images/header_1.png" alt="" style="width:500px"/>
    <img src="images/header_2.png" alt="" style="width:500px"/>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Supporters and their priorities that will be shown on the footer (and on the supporters.html as well), please edit `_data/supporters.json` (prio, picture name, link, 0, width, height, tag). Note that width and height are important since they are used to show the pictures in a good aspect ratio. You can easily get this info in linux as follows:
```
$ file vmware.jpg
