### Call for Papers
Future mobile networking aims to support ultra low latency, context-related service offering, personalised service delivery and highly flexible and efficient resource management. One of the key approaches to meet these targets focuses on the introduction of virtualized compute and storage resources at the edge of the network, having closer proximity to mobile subscribers. This approach has the potential to reduce end-to-end latency and time-to-response, while increasing the flexibility and agility of allocating resources. The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm takes this approach  to facilitate computation/storage capabilities at the edge, with a particular focus on their interaction with applications and services. In a similar fashion, virtualisation brings advantages related with the flexible realization and management of network and application functionality on top of virtualized compute, storage and network resources. As a consequence a new promising landscape is being shaped, where key capabilities of resource virtualization and programmability foster the emergence of intelligent solutions at the edge of the network.     

At the same time, the prospect of MEC is set to change several of the standard assumptions we make about the Internet. For instance, in a distributed storage and compute architecture it is not clear who owns what and therefore, who to trust when making use of the edge storage and compute components. This is in contrast to today’s landscape, where a few big stakeholders dominate the “Public Cloud”. Although getting more stakeholders involved could be a positive development in terms of user privacy, it requires extra research in order to guarantee security and establish a trusted computing environment.

MECOMM 2018 solicits papers that address aspects of the above areas with a main focus on facilitating communication solutions that enable dynamic and flexible edge architectures through joining concepts of softwarization and virtualization paradigms. Our workshop encourages papers that address cross-­layer research issues in any combination of these areas, bridging the gaps between network softwarization, virtualization and Cloud/Edge computing.

### Topics of Interest

- Function and service allocation in mobile edge networks
- Compute and process distribution models in mobile edge networks
- Content distribution models in mobile edge computing
- Application- and service-aware cloud models for mobile edge networks
- Algorithms and protocols to support the allocation of virtual resources
- Security challenges in mobile edge computing
- Service abstraction and orchestration
- QoS and traffic engineering in mobile edge networks networks
- Prototype platforms and trial deployment experience
- Data storage and networking in application- and/or service-aware cloud
- Next generation mobility architectures
- Distributed ledger technology and blockchain for mobile edge networking
- Management and orchestration across compute, storage and network resources in future mobile edge networks
- Content, function and result caching and replication in mobile edge networks 
- QoE in mobile edge networks
- Theoretical and experimental evaluations of mobile edge computing
- Self-organisation in mobile edge networks
- Edge computing for constrained mobile networks


### Submission Instructions
Submission implies the willingness of at least one author to attend the workshop and present the paper. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM SIGCOMM conference proceedings. Workshop organizers reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the workshop if the paper is not presented at the conference. Submitted papers should contain original material that have not be previously published, nor currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. All submissions should be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 6 printed pages, including all the figures, references and appendices. The ACM SIGCOMM LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the ACM SIG Proceedings website.

Specifically, please note the following format requirements:

- All papers submitted will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) and evaluated based on their suitability (i.e., within the workshop scope), novelty, and merit. 
- All papers must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically. Whatever text processor or formatter you use to write your paper (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, FrameMaker, etc.), please convert the output to PDF before submission.
- Submissions must be limited to **6 pages**, single-spaced, double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns, use at least a 10pt font, and be correctly formatted to be printed on letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. <span style="color:red">**Submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed**</span>.
- We must be able to print your paper once it is submitted. Therefore, all fonts used in the paper MUST be embedded in the submitted PDF file.
- The paper must be in a state where it can be printed clearly on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to view your paper in color.

Please submit your paper via [https://mecomm18.hotcrp.com/](https://mecomm18.hotcrp.com/).
