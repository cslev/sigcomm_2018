Because Hungary is part of the Schengen Area, citizens of the EU member states, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, USA, and many other countries may travel to Budapest without a visa. Please check immediately whether you need a Schengen visa to enter Hungary, e.g., by looking up the [visa requirements for citizens of your nationality on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Visa_requirements_by_nationality) or by directly contacting the Embassy of Hungary accredited to the country of your current residence. If you do need the Schengen visa, please proceed promptly with applying for the visa because visa processing is unpredictable and might take a significant amount of time


## Visa support letter
As part of the visa application process, you may be required to include a visa support letter. To request a visa support letter, register for the conference and then email your request to the [ACM Headquarters](mailto:supportletters@acm.org?subject=SIGCOMM 2018: request for a visa support letter) with the following information included:

 - Your name as it appears in your passport;
 - Your current postal mailing address; 
 - ACM SIGCOMM 2018 as the name of the conference you wish to attend; 
 - Your registration confirmation number;
 - If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the “sole author” or a “co-author”.
 
 
 Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter by email in 7-10 business days. The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter. Please print out your PDF visa support letter and take it with you to your visa appointment. The original letter is mailed only upon an explicit request. Note that visa support letters will be provided to only those participants who have registered and paid for the conference. Should a participant withdraw from the conference after the issue of the visa support letter, the consulate will be notified of the withdrawal accordingly.
 
 
 Please note that the ACM does not issue formal letters of invitation to any ACM-sponsored conferences.
